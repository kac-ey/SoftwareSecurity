# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a financial consultation company responsible for retirement, saving, investment and insurance plans tailored to each individual client. They requested a vulnerability assessment be performed on their preexisting RESTful API, as well as suggestions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

Based on the information provided from Artemis Financial, I was able to aptly identify client needs, and potential attacks and threats to the company. I identified the areas of security that needed to be addressed, identified vulnerabilities present in the existing code and provided a clear and detailed action plan on how to remedy these vulnerabilities. I recognize that a secure API, especially for a financial institution, is paramount to avoid legal action from the government, as well as building and maintaining the trust of clients. There are significant legal, financial, and moral repercussions if a company does not have secure software.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Understanding the vulnerability report was challenging, as was identifying the specific areas of security that should be focused on. The vulnerability report is a very high volume of high level information, and I am sure I still have much room for progress in truly understanding the complications it identifies. Identifying the areas of security that are applicable to a given application was equally as challenging, but less overwhelming. After a fair amount of reading from various sources, I found myself with a broader understanding of software security and how best to select areas, and I gained a significan amount of unrelated knowledge in this endeavour.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

My first step was recognizing the needs of the individul client. For instance, Artemis Financial is a financial institution and is therefore required to adhere to certain governmental security requirements. These were the first areas I addressed. I then considered potential threats from attackers to ensure the recommendations I provided would address these as well. I found the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to be of great help in identifying and mitigating software security weaknesses, and will use it as a resource in any future situations.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

A visual inspection identified a few security vulnerabilities. After completing a visual inspection, I was able to run a dependency check with Maven, and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which is part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), provided a plethora of resources for in depth explanations of the vulnerability, as well as how to fix them if a solution exists.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

As previously mentioned, OWASP was an invaluable resource. They have various resources identifying the most common and detrimental weaknesses, as well as guidelines to preventing these attacks. NIST was also incredibly useful. Some of the best people in the security field come together to make recommendations for security standards, and they are consistently updating potential vulnerabilities.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

While this is still a new concept and I have progress to make, I believe I was able to sufficiently identify customer needs and potential threats, outline them in a detailed yet comprehensible manner, and provide ample mitigation strategies for the most detrimental security weaknesses.
